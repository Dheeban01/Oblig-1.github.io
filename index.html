                 <p>
                     I am a pro-racer. I've been racing for over 15 years. I been participating in the big leagues for about 5-6 years.
                     Driving fast is one of my favorite things to do, but of course on track. I also drift aswell, but that is just a hobby.
                     I'm 25 years old, soon 26, but still young. Other things I like to do are watching movies, hanging out with friends, 
                     roadtrips and dirtbike. I do really like to watch Marvel movies, DC and fast and the furious. I recommend watching all of them.

        <h2>My first project</h2>
            <p>
                The first project of mine is the BMW on the top center. That is own build, and it is 
                built to drift. It is really one the most important accomplishments in my life. It 
                means so much that I've built it and it has made so many memories. Both me drifting alone, 
                and with friends. Sometimes the mess with me, because what is under the hood, but... <br><em>"The 
                only thing that matters is who's behind the wheel"</em> - Toretto</br>

            <h2><strong>A Dream Came Through</strong></h2>
            <p>
                The image on the buttom left is a little part of the inside of my carshop. For not too long ago I 
                was just a Co-Owner, but now I fully own it myself. That is also a big goal achieved. BMW is in my heart, but 
                you got to make money to build more cars, and through BMW contacts I got a good offer. Actually, about 3 weeks 
                ago I became Co-Owner of Porche Ryen. Through this you get money, but not enough to beat Bruce.

            <h2>Bought it just for fun</h2>
            <p>
                As the title says, I really bought it just for fun. It doesn't make to much of a profit, ups and downs. 
                Money wasn't the goal with buying the pizzeria. It was actually just for giveaways for fun. That also might be 
                the reason behind not much of a profit. All of the profit that comes from the pizzeria goes to people that can't 
                afford much. Not many people know that, but now everyone knows. <br><em>"It's not who I am underneath

                Shortly I'll tell what I did. First I was thinking about what I was going to right. 
                About me og a fiction character. I turned to be a little bit of both. I knew that somewhere I was 
                going to make you read again. Exampel: quotes, I put them in cursive. I also that that making some topic bigger, 
                smaller, thicker would catch your attention. From visually to more in the inside. I used "pre" and "/pre" not make 
                different pharagraphs, but just to start at the next line. Aswell as that I used different headings. Different locations 
                for where the text would start, left or center. I changed the structure of the images, how they would stay on different 
                sports. I used for exampel "btn" to make buttons, some extra to make some magic moves. <br><b>My full
                    name is Pradheeban Sivaranjan and my studentnumber is s364698.</b>
